# Time Line

A ReactJS application for users to save pictures and descriptions of their best moments.

The main focus is on practicing and improving my React skills, so both the requests and the database are mocked.

The app is based on a React application developed in a course called Nlw Spacetime by Rocketseat. However, in the course, Next and Tailwind are used, while this application uses ReactJS and styled-components, in addition to other modifications.
